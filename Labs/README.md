### Lab Contents  
The labs are designed to be followed in numerical order (01 - 07), with each building upon concepts from previous labs:

1. **Introduction** → Understanding the basic concepts
2. **Point-Based Processing** → Pixel-level operations
3. **Spatial Processing** → Neighborhood operations
4. **Features** → Extracting meaningful information
5. **Evaluation** → Measuring performance
6. **Graph-Based** → Advanced structural analysis
7. **Morphology** → Shape and structure operations
