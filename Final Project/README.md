### Overview

This project explores mathematical morphology techniques applied to remote sensing imagery, with a focus on:
- Basic morphological operations (opening, closing, erosion, dilation)
- Attribute profiles and attribute filters
- Pattern spectra for texture analysis and image characterization

### Activities

1. Activity 1: Morphological Operations on Satellite Images  

**Objectives:**
- Apply fundamental morphological operations to satellite imagery
- Understand the effects of erosion, dilation, opening, and closing
- Explore structuring elements and their impact on image features


2. Activity 2: Attribute Profiles and Filtering  

**Objectives:**
- Implement attribute filters for selective feature extraction
- Create attribute profiles for multi-scale image analysis
- Compare attribute-based methods with traditional morphological operations


3. Activity 3: Pattern Spectra Analysis for building detection
**Notebook:** `Activity_3/patter_spectrum2.ipynb`

**Objectives:**
- Compute pattern spectra from satellite imagery
- Analyze texture and structural characteristics using spectral signatures
- Apply pattern spectra for image classification and comparison
